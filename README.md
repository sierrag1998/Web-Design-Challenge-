Use the URL to explore my webpage, Latitude. It is a 7 page website that explores the relationship of Latitude and various weather conditions to see trends across the world. It consists of the home page, the plot page which leads to the 4 visualizations pages to see each graph in greater detail, the comparisons page to see the 4 graphs side by side, and the data page to see the data table used to make the graphs. Use the navigation bar at the top to navigate to different pages. Try the website on different size screens to see the styling and format difference. 


The following repository includes 7 .html files (one for each page), one CSS files for style coding, an image folder containing the images of the grpahs used on the website, and a Resources folder, containing the CSV file of the data used on the website.
